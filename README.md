# Sempub
*increments semantic version, pushes to git, and publishes to NPM*

I DON'T RECOMMEND USING THIS YET! PLEASE WAIT FOR VERSION 1.0.0 !!!🚨⚠️🔥⚡🚨⚠️🔥⚡🚨⚠️🔥⚡
IF YOU DO YOUR S WILL POTENTIALLY BREAK LOL 🔥

If you are trying to get this working, you will most likely need to npm init and have your git remote set up already.

## Installation

```bash
npm i sempub -g
```

## Usage


### Initialization

Initialization will walk you through a prompt to define what the command should do each time it is run. If you want to change the settings at any time, just run it again.

```bash
sempub init
```

### Publish

```bash
# will prompt for commit message
sempub publish

# will not prompt for commit message
sempub publish --message "commit message"
```
